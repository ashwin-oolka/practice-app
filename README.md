# Practice App 🚀

Hey there! 👋 This is a React Native mobile app I built using Expo and TypeScript. It's my playground for experimenting with different features and learning best practices in mobile development.

## What's Inside? 🎁

Here are some cool things you'll find in this app:

- Smooth navigation using Expo Router
- TypeScript for better code quality
- Modern and clean UI components
- Works on iOS, Android, and even web browsers
- Local storage with AsyncStorage
- Touch gestures and animations
- Date/time pickers for better user experience
- WebView integration for web content

## Getting Started 🛠️

Before diving in, make sure you've got these tools installed:

- Node.js (v14 or newer)
- npm or yarn (whichever you prefer)
- Expo CLI (just run `npm install -g expo-cli`)
- iOS Simulator (if you're on a Mac) or Android Studio (for Android development)

## Let's Get Coding! 💻

1. First, grab the code:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd practice-app
```

2. Install all the goodies:

```bash
npm install
# or if you're a yarn person
yarn install
```

3. Fire up the development server:

```bash
npm start
# or
yarn start
```

## Handy Commands 🎯

Here are some commands you'll use often:

- `npm start` - Starts the Expo server
- `npm run android` - Runs on Android
- `npm run ios` - Runs on iOS
- `npm run web` - Runs in your browser
- `npm run test` - Runs tests
- `npm run lint` - Checks code quality
- `npm run reset-project` - Resets the project (use with caution!)

## How It's Organized 📁

The project structure is pretty straightforward:

```
practice-app/
├── app/                 # Where the magic happens
│   ├── (tabs)/         # Your tab screens live here
│   ├── context/        # State management stuff
│   └── _layout.tsx     # The main layout
├── assets/             # Images, fonts, etc.
├── scripts/            # Helper scripts
└── ...                 # Other config files
```

## Tech Stack 🛠️

I'm using some awesome tools:

- Expo SDK 52 (latest and greatest)
- React Native 0.76.9
- React Navigation for smooth transitions
- TypeScript for type safety
- A bunch of Expo modules for extra features

## Development Tips 💡

1. Navigation is handled by Expo Router - it's super intuitive
2. TypeScript is your friend for catching bugs early
3. ESLint keeps the code clean and consistent
4. Jest is ready for your tests

## Building for Production 🏗️

Ready to share your app with the world? Here's how:

1. Get the EAS CLI:

```bash
npm install -g eas-cli
```

2. Set up your build:

```bash
eas build:configure
```

3. Build it:

```bash
eas build --platform ios
# or for Android
eas build --platform android
```
